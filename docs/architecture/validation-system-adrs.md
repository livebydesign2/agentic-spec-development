## ADR-001: ValidationManager Core Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

The ASD project requires a comprehensive validation system to ensure specification quality, workflow integrity, and system consistency. The system must integrate with existing ASD components (SpecParser, WorkflowStateManager, TaskRouter) while providing extensible validation capabilities.

### Decision Drivers

- Integration with existing ASD architecture patterns
- Performance requirements (<2s for 100+ specs, <100ms for single spec)
- Extensibility for future validation rules and auto-fixing capabilities
- Safety mechanisms for automated changes
- Quality gates for workflow operations

### Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Validator**: Single class handling all validation logic
2. **Rule-Based System**: Pluggable rules with a central orchestrator
3. **Event-Driven System**: Validation triggered by file/workflow events
4. **External Tool Integration**: Use existing validation tools

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Rule-Based System with Central Orchestrator**

**Reasoning**:

- Follows existing ASD patterns (ContextValidator, TaskRouter constraint engine)
- Provides extensibility through pluggable rules
- Enables performance optimization through rule categorization and caching
- Supports both manual validation and automated quality gates
- Allows incremental implementation and testing

### Positive Consequences

- Clear separation of concerns between rule logic and orchestration
- Easy to add new validation rules without modifying core system
- Performance can be optimized at both rule and system level
- Integration points are well-defined and testable
- Safety mechanisms can be implemented at the orchestration level

### Negative Consequences

- More complex initial implementation than monolithic approach
- Rule dependencies require careful management
- System complexity increases with number of rules
- Performance tuning requires attention to both individual rules and orchestration

### Implementation Notes

- ValidationManager acts as primary interface and orchestrator
- ValidationRuleEngine handles rule execution and result aggregation
- Individual ValidationRule classes implement specific validations
- Results follow standardized format for consistent error reporting
- Caching implemented at multiple levels for performance

## ADR-002: Pluggable Rule System Architecture

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

The validation system needs to support various types of validation (spec format, task dependencies, workflow consistency) with different rules that may evolve over time. The system should allow easy addition of new rules without modifying existing code.

### Decision Drivers

- Extensibility for new validation requirements
- Clear separation between rule logic and execution
- Support for different rule categories and severities
- Rule dependency management
- Performance optimization through selective rule execution

### Considered Options

1. **Class Inheritance**: Rules extend base ValidationRule class
2. **Interface-Based**: Rules implement ValidationRule interface
3. **Function-Based**: Rules are functions with metadata
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Rules defined in configuration files

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Class Inheritance with Interface Consistency**

**Reasoning**:

- Provides strong typing and interface consistency
- Allows shared functionality through base class
- Enables polymorphic rule handling
- Supports both simple and complex rule implementations
- Facilitates testing and debugging through consistent structure

### Implementation Patterns

```javascript
// Base rule class with common functionality
class ValidationRule {
  constructor(name, category, severity) {
    /* ... */
  }
  async validate(data, context) {
    /* Abstract method */
  }
  canAutoFix(error) {
    return false;
  }
  // Helper methods for results, context access
}

// Specific rule implementation
class RequiredFieldsRule extends ValidationRule {
  constructor() {
    super("required-fields", "spec", "error");
  }

  async validate(spec, context) {
    // Rule-specific validation logic
    return this.success() || this.error(message, code, data);
  }
}
```

### Rule Categories

- **spec**: Specification-level validation (format, required fields)
- **task**: Task-level validation (dependencies, agent types)
- **consistency**: Cross-spec consistency validation
- **workflow**: Workflow operation validation (quality gates)

### Rule Metadata System

- **Severity Levels**: error, warning, info
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Boolean flag with implementation
- **Dependencies**: Other rules that must run first
- **Performance Category**: For optimization grouping

## ADR-003: Auto-Fixing Framework with Safety Mechanisms

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

Users need automated fixing of common validation issues to reduce manual effort, but automated changes to specification files carry risks of data corruption or unintended modifications. The system must balance automation with safety.

### Decision Drivers

- User convenience through automated issue resolution
- Safety mechanisms to prevent data loss or corruption
- User control over automated changes
- Rollback capability for failed fixes
- Performance for batch operations

### Considered Options

1. **No Auto-Fixing**: Manual fixes only with suggestions
2. **Safe Auto-Fixing**: Limited to low-risk operations only
3. **Tiered Auto-Fixing**: Risk-based approach with user confirmation
4. **AI-Powered Auto-Fixing**: Machine learning for intelligent fixes

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Tiered Auto-Fixing with Risk Assessment and User Confirmation**

**Reasoning**:

- Balances automation benefits with safety requirements
- Allows users to control risk level they're comfortable with
- Provides clear risk assessment for informed decisions
- Enables rollback for failed operations
- Scalable from safe operations to more complex fixes over time

### Safety Mechanisms

```javascript
// Risk levels and confirmation requirements
const RISK_LEVELS = {
  low: {
    requiresConfirmation: false,
    operations: ["format-whitespace", "add-missing-field", "normalize-dates"],
  },
  medium: {
    requiresConfirmation: true,
    operations: ["fix-yaml-syntax", "update-default-values"],
  },
  high: {
    requiresConfirmation: true,
    operations: ["modify-id", "restructure-content", "change-dependencies"],
  },
};
```

### User Confirmation Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Identify all auto-fixable issues
2. **Risk Assessment**: Categorize fixes by risk level
3. **Preview Generation**: Show user what would be changed
4. **User Confirmation**: Get approval for non-trivial changes
5. **Backup Creation**: Create restore point before changes
6. **Atomic Execution**: Apply all fixes or rollback on failure
7. **Validation**: Re-validate files after fixes applied

### Rollback Strategy

- **File Backup**: Copy original files before modification
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing fix application
- **Validation Gates**: Post-fix validation with automatic rollback
- **User-Initiated Rollback**: Manual rollback command available

## ADR-004: Quality Gates Integration with Workflow Operations

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

The ASD workflow system (WorkflowStateManager, TaskRouter) needs validation checkpoints to prevent invalid operations before they cause system inconsistencies. Integration must be performant (<50ms) and non-intrusive to existing workflows.

### Decision Drivers

- Prevention of invalid workflow states
- Integration with existing WorkflowStateManager and TaskRouter
- Performance requirements for real-time operations
- Non-intrusive integration approach
- Clear error reporting for blocked operations

### Considered Options

1. **Pre-Operation Validation**: Check validity before operations
2. **Post-Operation Validation**: Validate after operations complete
3. **Event-Based Validation**: Listen to workflow events and validate
4. **Embedded Validation**: Add validation directly to workflow classes

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Pre-Operation Validation with Hook System**

**Reasoning**:

- Prevents invalid operations before they execute
- Maintains separation of concerns through hooks
- Allows existing code to remain largely unchanged
- Provides clear blocking mechanism with error reporting
- Performance can be optimized through caching and selective validation

### Integration Pattern

```javascript
// Hook-based integration with WorkflowStateManager
class WorkflowStateManager {
  async assignTask(specId, taskId, agentType, options = {}) {
    // Execute pre-hooks (including quality gates)
    const hookData = await this.hookManager.executePreHooks("assignTask", {
      specId,
      taskId,
      agentType,
      options,
    });

    // Proceed with original operation if hooks pass
    return this.originalAssignTask(hookData);
  }
}

// Quality gate as pre-hook
this.hookManager.registerPreHook("assignTask", async (data) => {
  const gateResult = await qualityGateManager.enforceAssignmentGate(
    data.taskId,
    data.agentType
  );

  if (!gateResult.allowed) {
    throw new Error(`Assignment blocked: ${gateResult.reason}`);
  }

  return data; // Allow operation to proceed
});
```

### Quality Gate Types

1. **Assignment Gates**: Task assignment validation

   - Agent capability checking
   - Task readiness validation
   - Workload capacity validation
   - Dependency satisfaction

2. **Transition Gates**: Status transition validation

   - Valid transition paths
   - Completion requirement checking
   - Phase progression rules

3. **Completion Gates**: Task completion validation
   - Deliverable verification
   - Quality criteria satisfaction
   - Handoff preparation

### Performance Optimization

- **Gate Result Caching**: Cache validation results for repeated operations
- **Parallel Rule Execution**: Run independent rules concurrently
- **Selective Gate Activation**: Enable/disable gates based on configuration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track gate execution times and optimize slow rules

## ADR-005: Error Handling and Result Format Standardization

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

The validation system needs consistent error reporting across all validation rules, auto-fixing operations, and quality gates. Users need clear, actionable error messages with specific location information and fix suggestions.

### Decision Drivers

- Consistent error format across all validation components
- Actionable error messages with fix suggestions
- Structured data for programmatic error handling
- Support for different severity levels
- Integration with CLI reporting and UI display

### Considered Options

1. **Simple String Errors**: Basic error messages as strings
2. **Structured Error Objects**: Rich error objects with metadata
3. **Exception-Based**: Use JavaScript exceptions for errors
4. **Result Pattern**: Success/failure objects with error details

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Structured Result Pattern with Rich Error Objects**

**Reasoning**:

- Provides consistent interface across all validation components
- Supports rich error metadata for better user experience
- Enables programmatic error handling and filtering
- Allows aggregation of multiple errors from different rules
- Facilitates different output formats (CLI, JSON, etc.)

### Result Format Specification

```javascript
// Standard validation result format
const ValidationResult = {
  success: boolean,
  errors: [
    {
      code: "ERROR_CODE",
      message: "Human-readable error message",
      data: {
        /* Additional error context */
      },
      rule: "rule-name",
      file: "/path/to/file",
      line: number, // Optional
      column: number, // Optional
      severity: "error" | "warning" | "info",
    },
  ],
  warnings: [], // Same format as errors
  info: [], // Same format as errors
  data: {}, // Additional result data
  fixes: [], // Available auto-fixes
};

// Aggregated results from multiple rules
const AggregatedResult = {
  success: boolean,
  summary: {
    total: number,
    passed: number,
    failed: number,
    errors: number,
    warnings: number,
    info: number,
  },
  byCategory: {
    spec: ValidationResult,
    task: ValidationResult,
    consistency: ValidationResult,
  },
  bySeverity: {
    error: [ErrorObject],
    warning: [WarningObject],
    info: [InfoObject],
  },
  results: [ValidationResult], // Individual rule results
  fixes: [FixObject], // All available fixes
  performance: {
    executionTime: number,
    averageTime: number,
  },
};
```

### Error Code Standardization

- **Naming Convention**: CATEGORY_SPECIFIC_ERROR (e.g., MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS)
- **Categories**: VALIDATION*, FIX*, GATE*, SYSTEM*
- **Severity Mapping**: Automatic severity based on error code prefix
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages through code mapping

### Fix Suggestion Format

```javascript
const FixSuggestion = {
  code: "FIX_CODE",
  description: "What this fix does",
  riskLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high",
  autoFixable: boolean,
  estimatedTime: number, // milliseconds
  preview: "What the change would look like",
  confirmation: {
    required: boolean,
    message: "Confirmation prompt for user",
  },
};
```

## ADR-006: Performance Architecture and Optimization Strategy

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2024-08-27  
**Deciders**: Software Architect Agent

### Context and Problem Statement

The validation system must meet strict performance requirements (<2s for 100+ specs, <100ms for single spec, <50ms for quality gates) while providing comprehensive validation capabilities. The system needs optimization strategies for both development and production use.

### Decision Drivers

- Strict performance requirements for user experience
- Scalability to large projects (100+ specifications)
- Real-time quality gate validation needs
- Memory efficiency for long-running processes
- Development experience (fast feedback during development)

### Considered Options

1. **Synchronous Processing**: Process all validation sequentially
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run validations concurrently
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load rules and data only when needed
4. **Caching Strategy**: Cache validation results and intermediate data
5. **Incremental Validation**: Only validate changed files

### Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multi-Level Optimization Strategy**

- **Parallel Rule Execution** for independent validations
- **Multi-Level Caching** for results, context, and parsed data
- **Lazy Loading** for rule discovery and spec loading
- **Incremental Validation** for file-watch scenarios

### Caching Architecture

```javascript
// Multi-level caching strategy
const CachingLevels = {
  // Level 1: Rule results cache
  ruleResults: {
    key: "file_path_rule_name_content_hash",
    ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes
    storage: "memory",
  },

  // Level 2: Context cache
  validationContext: {
    key: "project_state_hash",
    ttl: 60000, // 1 minute
    storage: "memory",
  },

  // Level 3: Parsed spec cache
  specMetadata: {
    key: "file_path_modification_time",
    ttl: 600000, // 10 minutes
    storage: "disk", // For large projects
  },
};
```

### Parallel Execution Strategy

- **Rule-Level Parallelization**: Independent rules run concurrently
- **Spec-Level Parallelization**: Multiple specs validated concurrently
- **Dependency-Aware Ordering**: Rules with dependencies run in correct order
- **Resource Pool Management**: Limit concurrent operations to prevent resource exhaustion

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Performance tracking and optimization
const PerformanceMetrics = {
  ruleExecutionTimes: Map, // rule_name -> [execution_times]
  cacheHitRates: Map, // cache_level -> hit_rate_percentage
  parallelizationEfficiency: Number, // speedup_factor
  memoryUsage: {
    current: Number,
    peak: Number,
    cacheSize: Number,
  },
  operationCounts: {
    validations: Number,
    cacheHits: Number,
    cacheMisses: Number,
  },
};
```

### Memory Management

- **Garbage Collection Optimization**: Explicit cleanup of large objects
- **Memory Pool**: Reuse objects for repeated operations
- **Streaming Processing**: Process large files without loading entirely into memory
- **Cache Size Limits**: LRU eviction for memory-bounded caches
