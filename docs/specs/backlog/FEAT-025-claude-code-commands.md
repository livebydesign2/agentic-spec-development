# FEAT-025: Claude Code Slash Commands Integration

## 📋 OVERVIEW

Integrate ASD workflow management with Claude Code's custom slash commands system by creating `.claude/commands/` directory with ASD-specific commands that provide seamless AI-first development experience.

**Business Value**: Eliminates context switching between ASD CLI and Claude Code, enabling agents to manage ASD workflows directly through slash commands with full context awareness.

**User Story**: As a Claude Code user working on ASD, I want to use slash commands like `/asd-status` and `/asd-next` so that I can manage workflows without leaving my AI conversation context.

## 🎯 GOALS & SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Primary Goals
- **Seamless Integration**: ASD workflows accessible via Claude Code slash commands
- **Context Preservation**: Commands maintain full ASD project context
- **Workflow Acceleration**: Reduce friction in AI-assisted development
- **Command Completeness**: Cover all essential ASD CLI operations

### Success Metrics
- ✅ All core ASD commands available as slash commands
- ✅ Commands work identically to ASD CLI equivalents  
- ✅ Zero context loss when using slash commands vs. CLI
- ✅ <500ms response time for status commands
- ✅ Agent workflow integration seamless

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.claude/commands/` directory with ASD slash commands
- [ ] Commands mirror ASD CLI functionality exactly
- [ ] Full project context maintained in command responses
- [ ] Documentation for agents on slash command usage
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing ASD CLI
- [ ] Error handling matches ASD CLI patterns

## 📝 DETAILED REQUIREMENTS

### Core Slash Commands

#### Project Status Commands
```bash
/asd-status          # Equivalent to: asd workflow status
/asd-dashboard       # Equivalent to: asd workflow dashboard  
/asd-progress        # Equivalent to: asd workflow progress
/asd-tasks           # Equivalent to: asd tasks
```

#### Task Management Commands  
```bash
/asd-next            # Equivalent to: asd next --agent [auto-detect]
/asd-assign          # Equivalent to: asd assign [spec] [task]
/asd-complete        # Equivalent to: asd complete [spec] [task]
/asd-research        # Equivalent to: asd research [spec]
```

#### Workflow Commands
```bash
/asd-handoffs        # Equivalent to: asd workflow handoffs
/asd-assignments     # Equivalent to: asd workflow assignments
/asd-validate        # Equivalent to: asd validate-assignment
```

### Command Features

#### Context Integration
- **Auto-detect agent type** from Claude Code conversation context
- **Preserve conversation state** across command executions
- **Rich formatting** using Claude Code's markdown support
- **Interactive elements** where appropriate

#### Error Handling
- **Identical error messages** to ASD CLI
- **Context-aware suggestions** for command fixes
- **Graceful fallbacks** when ASD CLI unavailable

#### Performance
- **<500ms response time** for status commands
- **<1s response time** for complex operations
- **Async operations** for long-running tasks

### Command Implementation Pattern
```markdown
---

parameters:
  - name: agent
    description: Filter by agent type (optional)
    type: string
    required: false

# ASD Workflow Status

This command shows your current ASD workflow assignments and project status.

## Usage
- `/asd-status` - Show all current assignments
- `/asd-status --agent software-architect` - Filter by agent type

## Implementation
```bash
asd workflow status ${agent ? '--agent ' + agent : ''}
```

The command will execute the ASD CLI and return formatted results with full context.
```

### Integration Architecture

#### Command Execution Flow
1. **Parse slash command** and extract parameters
2. **Map to ASD CLI command** with identical arguments
3. **Execute ASD CLI** with proper error handling
4. **Format response** for Claude Code display
5. **Preserve context** for follow-up commands

#### Context Management
- **Agent type detection** from conversation patterns
- **Project state caching** for performance
- **Session continuity** across command calls

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **CLI availability check** with graceful degradation
- **Parameter validation** matching ASD CLI patterns
- **User-friendly error messages** with suggested fixes
