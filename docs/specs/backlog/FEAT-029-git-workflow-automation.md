## **ü§ñ Agent Workflow**

See: `docs/ai-context/agent-workflow.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Each agent works on ONE TASK, then hands off to next agent**

**When picking up a task (e.g., TASK-001):**

1. **üéØ Product Check** _(Product-manager subagent)_: Ensure spec exists, numbering is correct, priority is set, and spec is in proper lifecycle state (backlog ‚Üí active)
2. **üìä Check Status**: What's the next available task? (look for ‚è≥ status)
3. **üîç Gather Context**: Read the context files below for this specific task
4. **üìã Plan Work**: Use `todowrite` if this task has >3 subtasks
5. **‚ö° Execute**: Complete ONLY your assigned task AND check off [x] subtasks

### **üìö Context Priority Levels** _(Prevent context window overload)_

## **üìã Work Definition** _(What needs to be built)_

## **Description**

Build comprehensive git workflow automation system that handles file tracking, automatic linting with error resolution, test execution with failure reporting, and git commit operations with proper formatting. This system integrates with the complete-current command to provide seamless task completion workflows.

### **Problem Statement**

Current task completion requires manual git operations, linting, and testing, leading to inconsistent code quality and process adherence. Automated git workflows are needed to ensure reliable, consistent task completion with proper quality gates and error handling.

### **Solution Approach**

Build integrated git automation system that tracks modified files during work sessions, executes quality checks (linting, testing) with automatic error resolution attempts, generates properly formatted commit messages, and handles pre-commit hook failures with intelligent retry logic.

### **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Automated file tracking during work sessions for selective commits
- [ ] Automatic linting execution with error resolution attempts
- [ ] Test suite execution with clear failure reporting
- [ ] Properly formatted commit message generation following project conventions
- [ ] Pre-commit hook failure handling with retry logic
- [ ] Integration with complete-current command for seamless workflow

## **üí° Implementation Notes** _(Update as you learn)_

### **Key Decisions**

- **Shell Integration**: Use child_process for git command execution with proper error handling and timeout management
- **Quality Pipeline**: Sequential execution (linting ‚Üí testing ‚Üí commit) ensures each quality gate passes
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive rollback capabilities preserve repository state integrity

### **Gotchas & Learnings**

- Git operations can fail in complex repository states - comprehensive validation essential
- Pre-commit hooks can modify files, requiring re-staging and retry logic
- Linting and testing timeouts need careful tuning for different project sizes

### **Future Improvements**

- Parallel execution of independent quality checks for performance optimization
- Machine learning for commit message generation based on file changes
- Integration with external CI/CD systems for broader quality pipeline
