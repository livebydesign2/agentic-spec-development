## Technical Design Details

### WorkflowStateManager Class Architecture

```javascript
class WorkflowStateManager {
  constructor(specParser, configManager) {
    this.specParser = specParser;
    this.configManager = configManager;
    this.stateDir = '.asd/state/';
  }

  // Assignment management
  assignTask(specId, taskId, agentType)        // Assign task to agent
  completeTask(specId, taskId, notes = '')     // Mark task complete
  completeSubtask(specId, taskId, subtaskId)   // Mark subtask complete
  getCurrentAssignments()                      // Get all active assignments

  // State management
  updateTaskProgress(specId, taskId, progress) // Update task progress
  getProjectProgress()                         // Calculate overall progress
  getSpecProgress(specId)                      // Get progress for specific spec
  validateState()                              // Check state consistency

  // Handoff management
  detectHandoffs()                             // Find ready handoffs
  prepareNextTask(specId, taskId)              // Prepare context for next task
  getHandoffStatus()                           // Get handoff readiness

  // Inline documentation
  updateSpecFrontmatter(specPath, updates)     // Update spec YAML frontmatter
  syncSpecState(specId)                        // Sync state with spec file

  // Internal methods
  _loadState()                                 // Load state from files
  _saveState()                                 // Save state to files
  _atomicUpdate(filePath, updateFn)            // Atomic file updates
}
```

```

## Testing Strategy Details

### Unit Tests

- WorkflowStateManager core methods with various scenarios
- Frontmatter update logic with different YAML structures
- Progress calculation with complex task hierarchies
- Handoff detection with various completion states

### Integration Tests

- WorkflowStateManager integration with SpecParser
- End-to-end assignment and completion workflow
- Concurrent state updates and file access
- CLI command integration with state management

### Performance Tests

- State update performance with large numbers of specs
- Frontmatter update performance with large files
- Concurrent access performance and safety
- Memory usage with extensive assignment history

</details>

---

## 💡 Implementation Notes _(Update as you learn)_

### Key Decisions

- Use JSON files for state storage (performance) with atomic updates for consistency
- Update spec frontmatter inline rather than creating separate completion documents
- Handoff detection based on subtask completion rather than manual triggers

### Gotchas & Learnings

- Frontmatter updates must preserve existing YAML structure and comments
- Concurrent CLI operations require careful state file locking
- Progress calculation needs to handle partial task completion accurately

### Future Improvements

- Real-time websocket updates for multi-user scenarios
- Advanced progress visualization and reporting
- Integration with external project management tools
