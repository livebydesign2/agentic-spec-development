## **🤖 Agent Workflow**

See: `docs/ai-context/agent-workflow.md`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each agent works on ONE TASK, then hands off to next agent**

**When picking up a task (e.g., TASK-001):**

1. **🎯 Product Check** _(Product-manager subagent)_: Ensure spec exists, numbering is correct, priority is set, and spec is in proper lifecycle state (backlog → active)
2. **📊 Check Status**: What's the next available task? (look for ⏳ status)
3. **🔍 Gather Context**: Read the context files below for this specific task
4. **📋 Plan Work**: Use `todowrite` if this task has >3 subtasks
5. **⚡ Execute**: Complete ONLY your assigned task AND check off [x] subtasks

## **📋 Work Definition** _(What needs to be built)_

## **Description**

Implement real-time state synchronization system that maintains consistency between YAML frontmatter in specification files, JSON state files, and git repository state. This system provides the foundation for reliable automation by ensuring all data stores remain synchronized with <2 second latency.

### **Problem Statement**

Current ASD state management relies on manual synchronization between YAML frontmatter, JSON state files, and git history, leading to state inconsistencies and workflow failures. Real-time synchronization is required for automation reliability with conflict resolution and manual override capabilities.

### **Solution Approach**

Build event-driven synchronization system using file system watchers (chokidar) to monitor changes across all state stores, with automatic bi-directional sync, state validation, conflict resolution, and comprehensive audit logging.

### **Success Criteria**

- [x] Real-time synchronization between YAML frontmatter and JSON state files
- [x] File system watchers detect changes within 1 second
- [x] State consistency validation with automatic repair capabilities  
- [x] Conflict resolution with manual override options
- [x] Comprehensive audit logging for all sync operations
- [x] System throughput handles 100+ concurrent operations
- [x] Sync operations complete in <2 seconds

## **Detailed Requirements**

### **REQ-001: Real-time File System Monitoring**

**As a** automated workflow system  
**I want** to detect changes in YAML frontmatter and JSON state files within 1 second  
**So that** state synchronization can maintain consistency across all data stores

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] File watchers monitor `docs/specs/**/*.md` for YAML frontmatter changes
- [ ] File watchers monitor `.asd/state/*.json` for JSON state changes
- [ ] Change detection includes file path, modification type, and timestamp
- [ ] Debouncing prevents excessive event firing (500ms window)
- [ ] Error handling manages file system access issues gracefully
- [ ] System handles 100+ concurrent file operations without performance degradation

### **REQ-002: Bi-directional State Synchronization**

**As a** development workflow  
**I want** changes in YAML frontmatter to automatically sync to JSON state and vice versa  
**So that** all systems always have consistent state information

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] YAML frontmatter status changes trigger JSON state updates
- [ ] JSON assignment changes trigger YAML frontmatter updates
- [ ] Atomic operations ensure complete sync or complete rollback
- [ ] Sync operations complete in <2 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for all synchronization operations
- [ ] Integration with existing WorkflowStateManager preserves current functionality

### **REQ-003: State Consistency Validation and Conflict Resolution**

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automatic detection and resolution of state inconsistencies  
**So that** workflow automation remains reliable even when conflicts occur

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Automatic detection of inconsistencies between YAML and JSON state
- [ ] Simple inconsistencies resolved automatically with audit logging
- [ ] Complex conflicts escalated to manual override system
- [ ] Manual override UI provides clear resolution options
- [ ] Rollback capabilities restore previous consistent state
- [ ] Confidence scoring determines automatic vs manual resolution paths

## **Technical Design Details**

### **Architecture Overview**

```
File System Changes
       ↓
[File Watchers] → [Change Detection] → [Event Bus]
       ↓                                    ↓
[State Validator] ← [Sync Engine] ← [Event Router]
       ↓                ↓
[Conflict Resolver] → [Manual Override UI]
       ↓
[Audit Logger] → [WorkflowStateManager]
```

### **Key Technical Principles**

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Decoupled components communicate via EventBus for maintainability
2. **Atomic Operations**: All sync operations complete fully or roll back completely - no partial states  
3. **Performance First**: <2 second sync operations through efficient change detection and processing
4. **Manual Override**: Human control preserved at all conflict resolution points

### **Implementation Notes**

- Use chokidar for reliable cross-platform file system monitoring
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic on file system errors
- EventBus pattern enables future extensibility for additional sync targets
- State validation uses deep comparison algorithms for accuracy
- Conflict resolution UI integrates with existing CLI command patterns

## **Testing Strategy Details**

### **Unit Tests**

- [ ] File watchers detect changes correctly across different operating systems
- [ ] State validation accurately identifies inconsistencies
- [ ] Sync engine handles bi-directional updates without infinite loops
- [ ] Conflict resolver categorizes conflicts correctly (simple vs complex)

### **Integration Tests**

- [ ] End-to-end sync workflow: YAML change → JSON update → validation
- [ ] Error scenarios: file system access denied, parse errors, network issues
- [ ] Performance testing: 100+ concurrent operations complete within time limits
- [ ] Integration with WorkflowStateManager preserves existing functionality

### **User Acceptance Tests**

- [ ] Real-time synchronization maintains consistency during normal development workflows
- [ ] Conflict resolution provides clear guidance when manual intervention required
- [ ] System performance remains acceptable under high-load scenarios
- [ ] Manual override capabilities provide escape hatch for automation failures

### **Gotchas & Learnings**

- File system watchers can fire multiple events for single changes - debouncing essential for performance
- YAML frontmatter parsing requires careful handling of edge cases and malformed content
- Atomic operations critical to prevent partial state corruption during sync failures

### **Future Improvements**

- Real-time UI dashboard for monitoring sync operations and conflicts
- Machine learning for improved conflict resolution confidence scoring
- Integration with external state stores (GitHub Issues, Jira) for broader synchronization
