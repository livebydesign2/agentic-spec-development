# Task Router System

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Backend Specialist

## üéØ Quick Start _(30 seconds)_

**What**: Intelligent task routing system that matches available tasks to agent capabilities with dependency validation and priority weighting

**Why**: Foundation for agentic workflows - enables "asd next" command to give agents contextually appropriate work

**Impact**: Core system enabling agent automation - agents can get next task without human intervention

### üöÄ AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-004** - CLI Integration & Commands  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-004 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: TASK-003 complete - ready to proceed

### üö¶ Current State _(AGENTS: Update this when you complete YOUR task)_

- **Next Available Task**: FEAT-013 COMPLETE - All tasks finished
- **Current Task Status**: TASK-004 completed - CLI Integration with comprehensive commands, filtering, and validation
- **Overall Progress**: 4 of 4 tasks complete (100% complete)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Last Updated**: 2024-08-26 by CLI Specialist (CLI Integration complete, FEAT-013 ready for done folder)

---

## üìã Work Definition _(What needs to be built)_

### Problem Statement

Currently, there's no systematic way for agents to determine what task to work on next. The system can parse specs and track progress, but lacks:

- Intelligent task recommendation based on agent capabilities
- Dependency validation to prevent blocked task assignment

Implement TaskRouter class that analyzes available tasks, validates dependencies, matches agent capabilities, and provides intelligent recommendations with priority weighting and filtering support.

### Success Criteria

- [x] ~~Agents can request next available task via "asd next" command~~ _(Core TaskRouter API implemented)_
- [x] ~~Task dependencies prevent assignment of blocked tasks~~ _(Dependency validation implemented)_

<summary><strong>üìñ Detailed Requirements & Design</strong> <em>(Expand when needed)</em></summary>

## Detailed Requirements

### REQ-001: Intelligent Task Recommendation

**As a** AI agent  
**I want** to get the next most appropriate task for my capabilities  
**So that** I can work efficiently without manual task assignment

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] TaskRouter analyzes all available tasks and recommends best match
- [ ] Recommendations consider agent type, capabilities, and context requirements
- [ ] Blocked tasks (missing dependencies) are never recommended
- [ ] Priority weighting ensures P0 tasks are preferred over lower priorities
- [ ] System provides reasoning for why a task was recommended

### REQ-002: Dependency Validation

**As a** system user  
**I want** task dependencies to be validated before assignment  
**So that** agents don't work on tasks that can't be completed

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Tasks with unmet dependencies are marked as blocked
- [ ] Dependency chains are resolved correctly (A depends on B depends on C)
- [ ] Circular dependencies are detected and flagged
- [ ] Dynamic dependency updates are supported (blocking/unblocking)
- [ ] Clear error messages explain why tasks are blocked

### REQ-003: Agent Capability Matching

**As a** project manager  
**I want** tasks assigned only to agents with appropriate capabilities  
**So that** work quality remains high and tasks are completed successfully

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Tasks specify required agent types (product-manager, ui-developer, etc.)
- [ ] Tasks specify context requirements (strategic-vision, technical-patterns, etc.)
- [ ] Agent capability profiles define what each agent type can handle
- [ ] Mismatched assignments are prevented with clear explanations
- [ ] System suggests alternative agents when primary choice unavailable

### REQ-004: Performance & Scalability

**As a** system user  
**I want** task routing to be fast and responsive  
**So that** agent workflows aren't slowed down by routing overhead

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Task routing completes in < 200ms for projects with 100+ specs
- [ ] Caching optimizes repeated routing requests
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable for large spec sets
- [ ] System handles concurrent routing requests safely
- [ ] Performance degrades gracefully with very large datasets

## Technical Design Details

### TaskRouter Class Architecture

```javascript
class TaskRouter {
  constructor(specParser, configManager) {
    this.specParser = specParser;
    this.configManager = configManager;
    this.cache = new Map();
  }

  // Core routing methods
  getNextTask(agentType, constraints = {})     // Primary recommendation API
  getNextTasks(agentType, limit = 5)           // Batch recommendations
  assignTask(taskId, agentId)                  // Task assignment
  blockTask(taskId, reason)                    // Dynamic blocking
  unblockTask(taskId)                          // Remove blocks

  // Analysis methods
  getDependencyChain(taskId)                   // Dependency tree analysis
  getReadyTasks(filters = {})                  // Available task queue
  getBlockedTasks()                           // Tasks waiting on dependencies
  validateAssignment(taskId, agentType)        // Assignment validation

  // Internal methods
  _loadAllTasks()                             // Load from SpecParser
  _validateDependencies(taskId)               // Check if dependencies met
  _matchAgentCapabilities(task, agentType)    // Capability matching
  _calculatePriority(task, constraints)       // Priority scoring
  _updateCache()                              // Cache management
}
```

### Priority Weighting Algorithm

```javascript
const priorityWeights = {
  P0: 1000, // Critical - always prioritized
  P1: 100, // High - important work
  P2: 10, // Medium - normal priority
  P3: 1, // Low - background tasks
};

const calculateTaskScore = (task, agentType, constraints) => {
  let score = priorityWeights[task.priority] || 1;

  // Boost for perfect agent match
  if (task.agent_type === agentType) score *= 2;

  // Boost for phase alignment
  if (constraints.phase && task.phase === constraints.phase) score *= 1.5;

  // Penalty for context mismatch
  const requiredContext = task.context_requirements || [];
  const agentCapabilities = this.getAgentCapabilities(agentType);
  const contextMatch = requiredContext.every((req) =>
    agentCapabilities.context_requirements.includes(req)
  );
  if (!contextMatch) score *= 0.5;

  return score;
};
```

### CLI Command Examples

```bash
# Basic next task
asd next --agent product-manager

# Filtered recommendations
asd next --agent ui-developer --priority P0,P1 --phase PHASE-1A

# Task management
asd assign TASK-001 --agent backend-specialist
asd block TASK-002 --reason "Waiting for design approval"
asd unblock TASK-002

# Task listing and analysis
asd tasks --status ready --agent product-manager
asd tasks --blocked --show-reasons
asd dependencies --task TASK-001 --depth 2
```

## üí° Implementation Notes _(Update as you learn)_

### Key Decisions

- TaskRouter integrates with existing SpecParser rather than reimplementing parsing
- Caching layer improves performance for repeated routing requests
- Agent capability matching uses context_requirements field from task definitions

### Gotchas & Learnings

- Dependency validation must handle circular references gracefully
- Priority weighting needs to balance urgency with agent capability fit
- Performance critical for large projects - caching and optimization required

### Future Improvements

- Machine learning for recommendation quality improvement
- Agent workload balancing and capacity planning
- Cross-project task routing and resource sharing

**Priority**: P0 - Foundation for agent automation  
**Effort**: 16 hours across routing engine, priority system, API, and CLI integration
**Impact**: Enables "asd next" workflow and intelligent agent task assignment
