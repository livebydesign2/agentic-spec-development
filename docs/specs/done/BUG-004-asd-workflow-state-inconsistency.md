# ASD Workflow State Inconsistency Issues

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P1 (High) | **Owner**: Software Architect

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Fix critical inconsistencies in ASD workflow state management that prevent proper task assignment and coordination

**Why**: These issues block effective use of ASD's self-managing development workflow, causing confusion and preventing proper agent coordination

**Impact**: Workflow automation broken - agents cannot reliably pick up and coordinate tasks

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Fix Task Status Synchronization  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs software architect to begin investigation
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 3 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-1 (Week 1 - Critical)
- **Blocker Status**: P1 HIGH - blocking effective workflow automation
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Bug created from MAINT-001 work

---

## Work Definition (What needs to be fixed)

### Problem Statement

During MAINT-001 work, several critical issues were discovered with ASD's workflow state management:

1. **Task Status Inconsistency**:

   - MAINT-001 TASK-001 shows as "complete" in assignment validation
   - But spec file clearly shows task as "pending"
   - `asd next` commands fail to find available tasks that should be ready

2. **Memory Monitor Runtime Error**:

   ```
   ReferenceError: decreases is not defined
   at MemoryMonitor.detectSteadyGrowth (/Users/tylerbarnard/Developer/Apps/asd/lib/memory-monitor.js:253:9)
   ```

   - This error appears on every ASD command execution
   - Indicates undefined variable in memory monitoring code

3. **Assignment Validation Failures**:
   - `asd assign MAINT-001 TASK-001 --agent cli-specialist` fails with "Task is not available (status: complete)"
   - But task is clearly pending and should be assignable
   - No clear guidance on how to resolve assignment conflicts

### Solution Approach

Systematically audit the workflow state management system, fix synchronization issues, resolve runtime errors, and improve validation reliability.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Task status accurately reflects spec file content
- [x] Memory monitor runs without errors
- [x] Task assignment works for all pending tasks
- [x] Clear error messages for assignment issues
- [x] Consistent state across all ASD commands

---

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **State Synchronization**: Audit how task status is parsed from spec files vs. tracked in workflow state
2. **Error Resolution**: Fix runtime errors preventing clean command execution
3. **Validation Improvement**: Enhance assignment validation with better error reporting

## Validation Requirements

### Documentation Checklist (REQUIRED before committing YOUR task)

- [ ] **Your Task Status**: Mark your task ‚úÖ and update all subtasks to `- [x]`
- [ ] **Current State**: Update "Next Available Task" to show what task is ready next
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Check off any criteria your task completed
- [ ] **Handoff**: Clear what the next agent should pick up
- [ ] **Issues Found**: Document any additional issues discovered during your work

### Testing Checklist (Follow this exact order)

**DURING DEVELOPMENT** (Test as you build each piece)

- [ ] **State Consistency**: Task status matches between spec files and workflow commands
- [ ] **Error-Free Execution**: All ASD commands run without runtime errors
- [ ] **Assignment Testing**: Can successfully assign pending tasks to agents
- [ ] **Command Integration**: `asd next`, `asd assign`, `asd tasks` all work properly

**BEFORE COMMITTING** (Required validation sequence)

- [ ] **Clean Execution**: All ASD commands run without errors
- [ ] **Task Assignment**: Can assign MAINT-001 TASK-001 successfully
- [ ] **Status Accuracy**: Task status accurately reflects spec file content
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Clear guidance when assignment or state issues occur
- [ ] **Regression**: Previous ASD functionality still works
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated workflow troubleshooting guidance

## Progress Tracking (AGENTS: Add entry when you complete YOUR task)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks (Add entry when you finish your task)

- No tasks completed yet

### üö® Task Blockers (Preventing next task pickup)

- **TASK-001**: Ready for Software Architect pickup - no blockers
- **TASK-002**: Blocked until TASK-001 state synchronization complete
- **TASK-003**: Blocked until TASK-002 runtime errors resolved

### üéØ Critical Path Impact

- **This directly affects MAINT-001**: Cannot properly coordinate CLI startup work without working task assignment
- **Blocks all workflow automation**: Other maintenance and feature work depends on reliable task coordination
- **User Experience**: Confusing errors prevent effective use of ASD's self-managing development

- **Memory Monitor**: `lib/memory-monitor.js` (runtime monitoring)
- **CLI Commands**: Assignment and task management commands

### Error Examples

```

**Memory Monitor Error**:

```
ReferenceError: decreases is not defined
    at MemoryMonitor.detectSteadyGrowth (/Users/tylerbarnard/Developer/Apps/asd/lib/memory-monitor.js:253:9)
```

### Common Patterns

- **State Synchronization**: Ensure spec file parsing matches workflow state
