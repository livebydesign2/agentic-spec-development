# Performance Analysis and Optimization Strategy

**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** done  
**Type:** SPIKE  
**Completed:** 2025-08-20

## Research Question

What are the primary performance bottlenecks in the ASD CLI tool and what optimization strategies would provide the most impact?

## Research Findings

### Startup Performance

- **Current:** 2-5 seconds for 100+ specifications
- **Bottleneck:** Synchronous file parsing during initialization
- **Solution:** Implement lazy loading with progressive parsing

### Memory Usage

- **Current:** ~200MB for 1000 specifications
- **Bottleneck:** No cache eviction strategy
- **Solution:** LRU cache with configurable limits

### Rendering Performance

- **Current:** 50ms render time causing UI lag
- **Bottleneck:** Full screen redraws on every update
- **Solution:** Incremental rendering with dirty region tracking

### File I/O Performance

- **Current:** 1-2 second delay on file changes
- **Bottleneck:** No debouncing of file watch events
- **Solution:** Batch file updates with 200ms debounce

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Lazy loading** - 80% startup improvement for minimal effort
2. **LRU cache** - 50% memory reduction
3. **Render throttling** - Smooth 60fps UI
4. **File watch debouncing** - 80% faster file updates

## Performance Targets

- Startup time: <500ms for any document count
- Memory usage: <100MB for 1000+ specifications
- UI response: <16ms (60fps) for all interactions
- File updates: <200ms response time

## Conclusion

Performance optimizations are feasible and would dramatically improve user experience. Recommend implementing in phases over 2-3 weeks with the lazy loading providing immediate wins.
