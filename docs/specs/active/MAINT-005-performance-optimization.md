# Performance Optimization

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P2 (Important) | **Owner**: Backend Developer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Optimize system performance to meet production response time requirements

**Why**: Poor performance creates user frustration and reduces adoption

**Impact**: Fast, responsive system improves user experience and enables scaling

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Performance Profiling & Bottleneck Analysis  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately (Phase 2 other tasks recommended)

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs backend developer to begin performance analysis
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-2 (Week 2 - Quality Systems)
- **Priority**: P2 - Important but not blocking other work
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

## Work Definition (What needs to be optimized)

### Problem Statement

Current performance may not meet production requirements for user adoption:

- CLI startup and command response times unknown
- Potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage
- Specification parsing may be slow with large codebases
- No performance monitoring or regression detection
- Performance bottlenecks not identified or addressed

### Solution Approach

Profile current performance, identify bottlenecks, optimize critical paths, implement monitoring, and validate improvements meet production requirements.

### Success Criteria

- [x] CLI startup time consistently under 1 second
- [x] All CLI commands respond within 2 seconds under typical usage
- [x] Memory usage optimized with no detectable memory leaks
- [x] Specification parsing performance improved by at least 50% from baseline
- [x] Performance regression detection prevents future slowdowns
- [x] Performance monitoring provides actionable insights for ongoing optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **Performance Analysis**: Profile current performance and identify bottlenecks
2. **Critical Optimization**: Optimize the most impactful performance issues
3. **Monitoring Implementation**: Add performance tracking and regression detection
4. **Validation**: Confirm performance improvements meet production requirements
