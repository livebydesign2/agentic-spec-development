# Workflow State Manager

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Backend Specialist

## üéØ Quick Start _(30 seconds)_

**What**: Dynamic state management system for real-time task assignments, progress tracking, and automated agent handoffs

**Why**: Enable seamless agent workflows with inline documentation updates and automatic handoff detection

**Impact**: Core workflow engine - tracks all agent work, updates progress, prepares handoffs automatically

### üöÄ AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-002** - Inline Documentation Updates  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-002 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - TASK-001 complete, can proceed immediately

### üö¶ Current State _(AGENTS: Update this when you complete YOUR task)_

- **Next Available Task**: TASK-002 - Inline Documentation Updates
- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 completed, TASK-002 ready for pickup
- **Overall Progress**: 1 of 5 tasks complete (20% - Excellent progress on DOG FOOD MILESTONE!)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Last Updated**: 2024-08-26 by Backend Developer

---

## üìã Work Definition _(What needs to be built)_

### Problem Statement

Currently, there's no systematic way to track agent work in real-time or manage handoffs between agents. The system lacks:

- Real-time tracking of who's working on what task
- Automatic progress updates in spec frontmatter (currently requires manual updates)
- Agent handoff detection and next task preparation
- Consolidated view of project progress and assignment status

### Solution Approach

Implement WorkflowStateManager that tracks assignments in real-time, updates spec files inline, detects completion and handoffs, and maintains progress state for all active work.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Real-time tracking of task assignments and progress
- [ ] Spec frontmatter updates automatically (no separate completion documents)
- [x] Agent handoffs detected and next tasks prepared automatically
- [x] Progress metrics accurate across all specs ("X of Y tasks complete")
- [x] CLI provides clear view of current assignments and handoff status
- [x] Performance: State updates complete in < 100ms for typical operations

---

## Technical Design Details

### WorkflowStateManager Class Architecture

```javascript
class WorkflowStateManager {
  constructor(specParser, configManager) {
    this.specParser = specParser;
    this.configManager = configManager;
    this.stateDir = '.asd/state/';
  }

  // Assignment management
  assignTask(specId, taskId, agentType)        // Assign task to agent
  completeTask(specId, taskId, notes = '')     // Mark task complete
  completeSubtask(specId, taskId, subtaskId)   // Mark subtask complete
  getCurrentAssignments()                      // Get all active assignments

  // State management
  updateTaskProgress(specId, taskId, progress) // Update task progress
  getProjectProgress()                         // Calculate overall progress
  getSpecProgress(specId)                      // Get progress for specific spec
  validateState()                              // Check state consistency

  // Handoff management
  detectHandoffs()                             // Find ready handoffs
  prepareNextTask(specId, taskId)              // Prepare context for next task
  getHandoffStatus()                           // Get handoff readiness

  // Inline documentation
  updateSpecFrontmatter(specPath, updates)     // Update spec YAML frontmatter
  syncSpecState(specId)                        // Sync state with spec file

  // Internal methods
  _loadState()                                 // Load state from files
  _saveState()                                 // Save state to files
  _atomicUpdate(filePath, updateFn)            // Atomic file updates
}
```

## üí° Implementation Notes _(Update as you learn)_

### Key Decisions

- Use JSON files for state storage (performance) with atomic updates for consistency
- Update spec frontmatter inline rather than creating separate completion documents
- Handoff detection based on subtask completion rather than manual triggers

### Gotchas & Learnings

- Frontmatter updates must preserve existing YAML structure and comments
- Concurrent CLI operations require careful state file locking
- Progress calculation needs to handle partial task completion accurately

### Future Improvements

- Real-time websocket updates for multi-user scenarios
- Advanced progress visualization and reporting
- Integration with external project management tools
