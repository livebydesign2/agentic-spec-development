# External User Readiness Validation

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P2 (Important) | **Owner**: Product Manager

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Validate ASD is ready for external users through fresh user testing

**Why**: Internal testing misses usability issues that external users will encounter

**Impact**: External validation ensures successful user adoption and identifies final issues before release

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**➡️ Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Design User Readiness Testing Strategy  
**📋 Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**🚦 Dependencies**: None - can start immediately (Sprint completion strongly recommended)

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs product manager to design user testing strategy
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 2 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-3 (Week 3-4 - Production Prep)
- **Prerequisites**: Production Readiness Sprint should be nearly complete for meaningful validation
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

## Work Definition (What needs to be validated)

### Problem Statement

Internal testing may miss critical usability issues that external users will encounter:

- Installation process may have undocumented dependencies or steps
- User onboarding experience may be confusing to fresh users
- Documentation may assume knowledge that new users don't have
- Error messages may not be helpful to users unfamiliar with the system
- Workflow complexity may exceed user expectations

### Solution Approach

Design comprehensive user readiness testing strategy and execute validation with external users to ensure production readiness.

### Success Criteria

- [x] External users can install and setup ASD successfully without assistance
- [x] New users can complete basic workflows within 10 minutes of installation
- [x] Installation success rate exceeds 95% across all supported platforms
- [x] User onboarding experience meets established usability standards
- [x] Critical user feedback incorporated into final release before production
- [x] Production readiness validated from external user perspective
