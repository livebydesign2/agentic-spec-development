# Test Suite Stabilization

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P1 (Critical) | **Owner**: QA Engineer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Fix test suite instability issues undermining development confidence

**Why**: Unstable tests create false failures, mask real issues, and slow development velocity

**Impact**: Developers lose trust in tests, leading to reduced quality assurance and increased bug risk

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Audit Test Suite Stability Issues  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs QA engineer to begin stability audit
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-1 (Week 1 - Critical)
- **Stability Target**: Achieve 95%+ test reliability over 50 consecutive runs
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

## Work Definition (What needs to be fixed)

### Problem Statement

The test suite has stability issues that undermine development confidence and CI/CD reliability:

- Flaky tests that pass/fail inconsistently
- Consistently failing tests blocking development
- Async test timing issues causing false failures
- CI/CD environment instability
- Poor test isolation leading to cross-test interference
- Slow test execution impacting development velocity
- Inadequate error reporting and debugging information

### Solution Approach

Systematically audit all test stability issues, fix critical failures, improve test environment reliability, and implement monitoring to maintain test health.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Test suite achieves 95%+ stability rate over 50 consecutive runs
- [x] Zero consistently failing tests blocking development
- [x] All flaky tests either fixed or disabled with issue tracking
- [x] CI/CD pipeline runs reliably without environment-related failures
- [x] Full test suite execution completes within 5 minutes
- [x] Clear test failure reporting with actionable debugging information
- [x] Automated test health monitoring and alerting operational

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **Stability Audit**: Analyze test failure patterns and identify root causes
2. **Critical Fixes**: Resolve consistently failing and flaky tests
3. **Environment Hardening**: Stabilize CI/CD and test isolation

- **Coverage**: Istanbul, nyc, or similar coverage reporting
- **Mocking**: Sinon, jest.mock, or similar mocking libraries

### Common Test Issues

- **Flaky Tests**: Non-deterministic behavior, timing issues, external dependencies
- **Failing Tests**: Outdated logic, changed APIs, incorrect assertions
- **Environment Issues**: Missing dependencies, configuration problems, resource conflicts
- **Performance**: Slow tests, inefficient setup/teardown, excessive I/O

### Stability Best Practices

- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and clean up after itself
- **Deterministic**: Tests should produce consistent results across runs
- **Fast**: Quick execution to support rapid development cycles
- **Clear**: Descriptive test names and failure messages
- **Maintained**: Regular updates to keep tests current with codebase changes
