# Pre-commit Quality Gates

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P1 (Critical) | **Owner**: DevOps Engineer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Implement automated quality gates that prevent poor quality code from being committed

**Why**: Quality issues slip into the codebase and accumulate technical debt that slows development

**Impact**: Automated quality gates maintain code quality and prevent technical debt accumulation

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Design Quality Gate Framework  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately (MAINT-002 completion recommended)

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs DevOps engineer to begin quality gate design
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-2 (Week 2 - Quality Systems)
- **Prerequisites**: MAINT-002 (code quality fixes) should be complete for optimal implementation
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

## Work Definition (What needs to be built)

### Problem Statement

Currently, there are no automated quality gates preventing poor quality code from entering the repository:

- No pre-commit validation of code quality standards
- Quality issues discovered only after code is committed
- Inconsistent application of linting and formatting rules
- No automated security vulnerability detection
- Missing validation of documentation and specification changes
- Manual quality checks are inconsistent and time-consuming

### Solution Approach

Implement comprehensive pre-commit quality gates that automatically validate code quality, security, testing, and documentation before allowing commits to proceed.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Pre-commit hooks automatically prevent commits that fail established quality standards
- [x] Quality gates validate linting, testing, security, and documentation requirements
- [x] Quality gate execution completes within 30 seconds to maintain developer productivity
- [x] Clear, actionable feedback guides developers to resolve quality issues efficiently
- [x] Emergency bypass mechanism available for critical fixes when quality gates block urgent work
- [x] Quality gates integrate seamlessly with existing development workflow and tools
- [x] CI/CD pipeline enforces same quality standards as local pre-commit hooks
- [x] Quality metrics and trends are tracked, reported, and used for continuous improvement

---

### Technical Approach

1. **Framework Design**: Define quality checks, thresholds, and integration strategy
2. **Quality Implementation**: Build comprehensive quality validation checks
3. **Git Integration**: Configure pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration
