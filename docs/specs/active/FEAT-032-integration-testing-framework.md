# Integration Testing Framework

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P1 (Critical) | **Owner**: QA Engineer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Implement comprehensive integration testing framework for production readiness validation

**Why**: Unit tests alone don't catch integration issues that occur when system components work together

**Impact**: Integration tests provide confidence that the complete system works correctly in production scenarios

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Design Integration Testing Strategy  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately (Phase 2 completion recommended)

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs QA engineer to begin integration testing design
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-3 (Week 3-4 - Production Prep)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 2 quality systems should be complete for optimal testing
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

## Work Definition (What needs to be built)

### Problem Statement

Current testing focuses on unit tests, leaving integration gaps that could cause production failures:

- No comprehensive testing of complete user workflows
- Integration between CLI, file system, and specification parsing untested
- End-to-end scenarios not validated in realistic environments
- No testing of error handling across system boundaries
- Missing validation of performance under realistic usage
- Lack of automated testing in CI/CD for integration scenarios

### Solution Approach

Design and implement comprehensive integration testing framework that validates complete system functionality, user workflows, and production scenarios.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Integration tests comprehensively cover all critical user workflows
- [x] End-to-end tests validate complete system functionality from CLI to file operations
- [x] Test framework supports automated execution with clear reporting
- [x] Tests run reliably in CI/CD environment without flakiness
- [x] Complete integration test suite execution within 10 minutes
- [x] Clear test failure reporting with root cause analysis for quick debugging
- [x] Test data management prevents test interference and ensures isolation
- [x] Integration tests catch system-level issues missed by unit tests
