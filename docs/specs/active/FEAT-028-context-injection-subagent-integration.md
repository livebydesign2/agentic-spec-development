## **ü§ñ Agent Workflow**

See: `docs/ai-context/agent-workflow.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Each agent works on ONE TASK, then hands off to next agent**

**When picking up a task (e.g., TASK-001):**

1. **üéØ Product Check** _(Product-manager subagent)_: Ensure spec exists, numbering is correct, priority is set, and spec is in proper lifecycle state (backlog ‚Üí active)
2. **üìä Check Status**: What's the next available task? (look for ‚è≥ status)
3. **üîç Gather Context**: Read the context files below for this specific task
4. **üìã Plan Work**: Use `todowrite` if this task has >3 subtasks
5. **‚ö° Execute**: Complete ONLY your assigned task AND check off [x] subtasks
