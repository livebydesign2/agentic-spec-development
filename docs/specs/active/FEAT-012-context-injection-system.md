# Context Injection System

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Software Architect

## üéØ Quick Start *(30 seconds)*

**What**: Implement comprehensive context injection system for AI agents with multi-layer context, automatic updates, and customizable workflows

**Why**: Enable sophisticated agent handoffs with rich context while maintaining human observability and customization

**Impact**: Foundation for all agentic workflows - agents get relevant context automatically, system learns and improves over time

### üöÄ AGENT PICKUP GUIDE
**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Core Context Storage & File Structure  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - foundational system component

### üö¶ Current State *(AGENTS: Update this when you complete YOUR task)*
- **Next Available Task**: TASK-001 - Core Context Storage & File Structure
- **Current Task Status**: None - ready for pickup  
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete
- **Blockers**: None
- **Last Updated**: 2024-08-24 by System Architect

---

## üìã Work Definition *(What needs to be built)*

### Problem Statement
Currently, agents receive minimal context and have no systematic way to accumulate learning or pass knowledge to subsequent agents. This results in:
- Repeated research across similar tasks
- Agents lacking project-specific context and constraints  
- No learning accumulation or pattern recognition
- Manual handoffs without structured context transfer
- Inconsistent agent behavior across different specs

### Solution Approach
Implement a comprehensive 4-layer context injection system with:
1. **Static Context**: Project config and agent capabilities
2. **Dynamic Context**: Real-time task assignments and progress
3. **Semi-Dynamic Context**: Research findings and implementation decisions
4. **Process Context**: Customizable workflow templates and validation checklists

### Success Criteria
- [x] Multi-layer context injection provides relevant context to agents automatically
- [x] Context files update automatically based on agent actions and CLI commands
- [x] System accumulates learning over time (research findings, decisions, patterns)
- [x] Users can customize agent workflows and validation templates
- [x] Context system integrates seamlessly with existing spec/task workflow
- [x] Performance: Context injection completes in < 500ms for typical tasks

---

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

## üí° Implementation Notes *(Update as you learn)*

### Key Decisions
- Use Claude's MD + YAML pattern for agent definitions (human readable + programmatic)
- 4-layer context system balances relevance with completeness
- Automatic update triggers capture learning without manual intervention

### Gotchas & Learnings  
- Context files must remain human-readable while supporting programmatic access
- Agent filtering prevents context overload but must not miss critical information
- File system performance critical for frequent context updates

### Future Improvements
- Semantic search for context relevance scoring
- Machine learning for context recommendation optimization
- Cross-project context sharing and pattern libraries
