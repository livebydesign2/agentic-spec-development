# Code Quality Violations

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Backend Developer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Fix 382 code quality violations identified in project audit

**Why**: Technical debt is accumulating rapidly and creating development friction that compounds over time

**Impact**: Poor code quality slows development, increases bugs, and makes the system harder to maintain

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-004** - Validate & Test Quality Improvements  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-004 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: All previous tasks complete ‚úÖ

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-003 complete ‚úÖ - TASK-004 ready for QA engineer pickup
- **Overall Progress**: 3 of 4 tasks complete (75%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-1 (Week 1 - Critical)
- **Violations**: 382 identified violations need systematic resolution
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

---

## Work Definition (What needs to be fixed)

### Problem Statement

Project audit identified 382 code quality violations across the codebase, including:

- Security vulnerabilities from static analysis
- Performance anti-patterns and inefficient code
- Maintainability issues (complex functions, poor naming)
- Missing documentation and comments
- Style and formatting inconsistencies
- Unused code and dead imports
- ESLint/TypeScript violations

### Solution Approach

Systematically audit all violations, prioritize by impact and effort, fix critical issues first, then resolve remaining violations while validating no functionality regression.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Zero critical code quality violations remaining
- [x] Less than 10 minor violations (acceptable technical debt)
- [x] All code passes established linting and TypeScript rules
- [x] No security vulnerabilities from static analysis tools
- [x] Measurable performance improvements from code optimization
- [x] Improved maintainability metrics (cyclomatic complexity, function size)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation for all public functions and classes
- [x] No unused code, dead imports, or unreachable code paths

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **Comprehensive Audit**: Run all static analysis tools and categorize violations by type and severity
2. **Strategic Prioritization**: Focus on security, performance, and maintainability issues first
3. **Systematic Resolution**: Fix violations in order of impact while preventing regression
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure fixes improve code quality without breaking functionality
