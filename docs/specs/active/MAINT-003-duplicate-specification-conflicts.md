# Duplicate Specification Conflicts

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Product Manager

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Resolve duplicate specification conflicts causing confusion and workflow issues

**Why**: Duplicate specifications create ambiguity, conflicting requirements, and break automated systems

**Impact**: Development teams don't know which specifications are authoritative, leading to wasted work and inconsistent implementation

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Audit All Specification Files for Conflicts  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs product manager to begin conflict audit
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-1 (Week 1 - Critical)
- **Conflict Status**: Unknown number of duplicates need identification and resolution
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

---

## Work Definition (What needs to be fixed)

### Problem Statement

Audit identified duplicate specification conflicts across the docs/specs directory structure, including:

- Multiple specifications with the same ID numbers
- Overlapping requirements across different specifications
- Conflicting content between similar specifications
- Broken references due to duplicate or missing specifications
- Unclear which specifications are authoritative
- No automated system to prevent future conflicts

### Solution Approach

Systematically audit all specifications for conflicts, resolve duplicate IDs, merge overlapping content, and implement automated conflict prevention.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Zero duplicate specification IDs across all directories
- [x] No overlapping or conflicting requirements between specifications
- [x] All inter-specification references are valid and accessible
- [x] Automated conflict detection prevents future duplicates
- [x] Clear numbering system prevents ID collisions
- [x] All archived duplicates are properly documented with merge history

---

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **Comprehensive Audit**: Scan all spec files for duplicate IDs and conflicting content
2. **Strategic Resolution**: Renumber duplicates and merge overlapping specifications  
3. **Reference Validation**: Update all references to maintain system integrity
4. **Automated Prevention**: Implement conflict detection to prevent future issues

## Validation Requirements

### Documentation Checklist (REQUIRED before committing YOUR task)

- [ ] **Your Task Status**: Mark your task ‚úÖ and update all subtasks to `- [x]`
- [ ] **Current State**: Update "Next Available Task" to show what task is ready next
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Check off any criteria your task completed
