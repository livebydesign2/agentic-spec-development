# Deployment Infrastructure

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P1 (Critical) | **Owner**: DevOps Engineer

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

**What**: Implement complete deployment infrastructure for production npm package distribution

**Why**: ASD needs professional deployment process to enable external user adoption

**Impact**: Automated deployment enables reliable distribution and updates for users

### AGENT PICKUP GUIDE

**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Design Deployment Strategy  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - can start immediately (Phase 3 other tasks recommended)

### Current State (AGENTS: Update when you complete YOUR task)

- **Current Task Status**: TASK-001 pending - needs DevOps engineer to begin deployment design
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete (0%)
- **Phase**: PHASE-STABILIZATION-3 (Week 3-4 - Production Prep)
- **Current State**: Pre-production software, not yet published to npm
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 by Product Manager - Sprint initiated

---

## Work Definition (What needs to be built)

### Problem Statement

ASD is currently not published to npm and lacks production deployment infrastructure:

- No automated CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying releases
- Package not configured for npm publishing
- No versioning or release management process
- Missing deployment quality gates and testing
- No rollback mechanism for failed deployments
- Installation requires manual git clone and npm link

### Solution Approach

Design and implement complete deployment infrastructure with automated CI/CD, npm publishing, quality gates, and release management.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Automated CI/CD pipeline builds, tests, and deploys on merge to main branch
- [x] Package publishes automatically to npm registry with proper semantic versioning
- [x] Users can install globally via `npm install -g agentic-spec-development`
- [x] Deployment pipeline includes comprehensive quality gates (tests, linting, security)
- [x] Rollback mechanism available for failed or problematic deployments
- [x] Release notes and changelog generated automatically from commits and pull requests
- [x] Complete deployment process documented for current and future maintainers
- [x] Production deployment validated end-to-end with actual npm installation

---

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach

1. **Deployment Strategy**: Design complete release workflow with versioning and automation
2. **CI/CD Implementation**: Build automated pipeline with quality gates and npm publishing
3. **Package Configuration**: Setup npm package for global installation and distribution
4. **Process Validation**: Test complete deployment workflow end-to-end
