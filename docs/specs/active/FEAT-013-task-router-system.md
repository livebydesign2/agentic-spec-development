# Task Router System

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: P0 (Critical) | **Owner**: Backend Specialist

## üéØ Quick Start *(30 seconds)*

**What**: Intelligent task routing system that matches available tasks to agent capabilities with dependency validation and priority weighting

**Why**: Foundation for agentic workflows - enables "asd next" command to give agents contextually appropriate work

**Impact**: Core system enabling agent automation - agents can get next task without human intervention

### üöÄ AGENT PICKUP GUIDE
**‚û°Ô∏è Next Available Task**: **TASK-001** - Core Task Routing Engine  
**üìã Your Job**: Work on TASK-001 only, then update docs and hand off  
**üö¶ Dependencies**: None - foundational system component

### üö¶ Current State *(AGENTS: Update this when you complete YOUR task)*
- **Next Available Task**: TASK-001 - Core Task Routing Engine
- **Current Task Status**: None - ready for pickup  
- **Overall Progress**: 0 of 4 tasks complete
- **Blockers**: None
- **Last Updated**: 2024-08-24 by System Architect

---

## üìã Work Definition *(What needs to be built)*

### Problem Statement
Currently, there's no systematic way for agents to determine what task to work on next. The system can parse specs and track progress, but lacks:
- Intelligent task recommendation based on agent capabilities
- Dependency validation to prevent blocked task assignment
- Priority weighting and constraint filtering
- Agent capability matching for appropriate task assignment

### Solution Approach
Implement TaskRouter class that analyzes available tasks, validates dependencies, matches agent capabilities, and provides intelligent recommendations with priority weighting and filtering support.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agents can request next available task via "asd next" command
- [ ] Task dependencies prevent assignment of blocked tasks
- [ ] Agent capability matching ensures appropriate task assignment
- [ ] Priority weighting considers P0/P1/P2/P3 levels and phase constraints
- [ ] System supports filtering by agent type, priority, and phase
- [ ] Performance: Task routing completes in < 200ms for projects with 100+ specs

<summary><strong>üìñ Detailed Requirements & Design</strong> <em>(Expand when needed)</em></summary>

## Detailed Requirements

### REQ-001: Intelligent Task Recommendation
**As a** AI agent  
**I want** to get the next most appropriate task for my capabilities  
**So that** I can work efficiently without manual task assignment

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TaskRouter analyzes all available tasks and recommends best match
- [ ] Recommendations consider agent type, capabilities, and context requirements
- [ ] Blocked tasks (missing dependencies) are never recommended
- [ ] Priority weighting ensures P0 tasks are preferred over lower priorities
- [ ] System provides reasoning for why a task was recommended

### REQ-002: Dependency Validation
**As a** system user  
**I want** task dependencies to be validated before assignment  
**So that** agents don't work on tasks that can't be completed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Tasks with unmet dependencies are marked as blocked
- [ ] Dependency chains are resolved correctly (A depends on B depends on C)
- [ ] Circular dependencies are detected and flagged
- [ ] Dynamic dependency updates are supported (blocking/unblocking)
- [ ] Clear error messages explain why tasks are blocked

### REQ-003: Agent Capability Matching
**As a** project manager  
**I want** tasks assigned only to agents with appropriate capabilities  
**So that** work quality remains high and tasks are completed successfully

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Tasks specify required agent types (product-manager, ui-developer, etc.)
- [ ] Tasks specify context requirements (strategic-vision, technical-patterns, etc.)
- [ ] Agent capability profiles define what each agent type can handle
- [ ] Mismatched assignments are prevented with clear explanations
- [ ] System suggests alternative agents when primary choice unavailable

### REQ-004: Performance & Scalability
**As a** system user  
**I want** task routing to be fast and responsive  
**So that** agent workflows aren't slowed down by routing overhead

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Task routing completes in < 200ms for projects with 100+ specs
- [ ] Caching optimizes repeated routing requests
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable for large spec sets
- [ ] System handles concurrent routing requests safely
- [ ] Performance degrades gracefully with very large datasets

## Technical Design Details

### TaskRouter Class Architecture
```javascript
class TaskRouter {
  constructor(specParser, configManager) {
    this.specParser = specParser;
    this.configManager = configManager;
    this.cache = new Map();
  }

  // Core routing methods
  getNextTask(agentType, constraints = {})     // Primary recommendation API
  getNextTasks(agentType, limit = 5)           // Batch recommendations
  assignTask(taskId, agentId)                  // Task assignment
  blockTask(taskId, reason)                    // Dynamic blocking
  unblockTask(taskId)                          // Remove blocks

  // Analysis methods
  getDependencyChain(taskId)                   // Dependency tree analysis
  getReadyTasks(filters = {})                  // Available task queue
  getBlockedTasks()                           // Tasks waiting on dependencies
  validateAssignment(taskId, agentType)        // Assignment validation

  // Internal methods
  _loadAllTasks()                             // Load from SpecParser
  _validateDependencies(taskId)               // Check if dependencies met
  _matchAgentCapabilities(task, agentType)    // Capability matching
  _calculatePriority(task, constraints)       // Priority scoring
  _updateCache()                              // Cache management
}
```

### Priority Weighting Algorithm
```javascript
const priorityWeights = {
  'P0': 1000,  // Critical - always prioritized
  'P1': 100,   // High - important work
  'P2': 10,    // Medium - normal priority
  'P3': 1      // Low - background tasks
};

const calculateTaskScore = (task, agentType, constraints) => {
  let score = priorityWeights[task.priority] || 1;
  
  // Boost for perfect agent match
  if (task.agent_type === agentType) score *= 2;
  
  // Boost for phase alignment
  if (constraints.phase && task.phase === constraints.phase) score *= 1.5;
  
  // Penalty for context mismatch
  const requiredContext = task.context_requirements || [];
  const agentCapabilities = this.getAgentCapabilities(agentType);
  const contextMatch = requiredContext.every(req => 
    agentCapabilities.context_requirements.includes(req)
  );
  if (!contextMatch) score *= 0.5;
  
  return score;
};
```

### CLI Command Examples
```bash
# Basic next task
asd next --agent product-manager

# Filtered recommendations
asd next --agent ui-developer --priority P0,P1 --phase PHASE-1A

# Task management
asd assign TASK-001 --agent backend-specialist
asd block TASK-002 --reason "Waiting for design approval"
asd unblock TASK-002

# Task listing and analysis
asd tasks --status ready --agent product-manager
asd tasks --blocked --show-reasons
asd dependencies --task TASK-001 --depth 2
```

## Testing Strategy Details

### Unit Tests
- TaskRouter core methods with various agent types and constraints
- Dependency validation with complex dependency chains
- Priority weighting algorithm with different scenarios
- Agent capability matching logic

### Integration Tests  
- TaskRouter integration with SpecParser and ConfigManager
- End-to-end task recommendation workflow

</details>

## üí° Implementation Notes *(Update as you learn)*

### Key Decisions
- TaskRouter integrates with existing SpecParser rather than reimplementing parsing
- Caching layer improves performance for repeated routing requests
- Agent capability matching uses context_requirements field from task definitions

### Gotchas & Learnings  
- Dependency validation must handle circular references gracefully
- Priority weighting needs to balance urgency with agent capability fit
- Performance critical for large projects - caching and optimization required

### Future Improvements
- Machine learning for recommendation quality improvement
- Agent workload balancing and capacity planning
- Cross-project task routing and resource sharing
