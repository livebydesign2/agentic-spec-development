# Memory Leak in File Watcher

**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** backlog  
**Type:** BUG

## Description

Memory usage continuously grows during extended file watching sessions, eventually causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Start ASD with auto-refresh enabled
2. Leave running for 2+ hours with active file editing
3. Monitor memory usage - grows from 50MB to 200MB+
4. Application becomes sluggish after 4+ hours

## Root Cause Analysis

Initial investigation suggests the issue is related to:

- Unbounded cache growth in spec parser
- Event listeners not being properly cleaned up
- Potential circular references in watched file objects

## Proposed Solution

- Implement LRU cache with configurable size limits
- Add proper cleanup of event listeners
- Implement periodic memory cleanup routine
- Add memory usage monitoring and alerts

## Environment

- Node.js v18.x
- macOS and Linux affected
- Occurs with 100+ specification files

## Severity

- **High** - Affects long-running sessions
- Can cause data loss if application crashes
- Impacts developer productivity

## Tasks

- [ ] Reproduce issue consistently
- [ ] Profile memory usage patterns
- [ ] Implement LRU cache for spec parser
- [ ] Add event listener cleanup
- [ ] Create memory monitoring system
- [ ] Add automated memory tests
- [ ] Verify fix across platforms
