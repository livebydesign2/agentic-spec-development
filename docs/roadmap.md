## 🎯 Strategic Decision Points

### Phase Gate 1: PHASE-1A → PHASE-1B

**Decision**: Transition to self-development or continue traditional approach?  
**Criteria**: Context injection, task routing, and state management operational  
**Recommendation**: **Transition to self-development** - validate architecture with real usage

### Phase Gate 2: PHASE-1B → PHASE-2A

**Decision**: Focus on advanced features or expand user base?  
**Criteria**: Production-ready CLI with quality systems  
**Recommendation**: Evaluate based on user feedback and adoption metrics

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

As we develop ASD, we'll continuously refine:

- **Agent workflow patterns** based on real usage
- **Context injection relevance** based on agent feedback
- **Task routing algorithms** based on assignment success rates
- **CLI usability** based on development efficiency gains

This roadmap represents our path from basic CLI to comprehensive agentic development platform, with the unique advantage of self-improvement through dogfooding at the 37% completion mark.
