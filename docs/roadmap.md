# ASD CLI Development Roadmap

**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Self-Use Target**: After PHASE-1A completion (56 hours of development)

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development of ASD (Agentic Spec Development) from a basic CLI tool to a comprehensive platform for AI-first development workflows. The architecture prioritizes clean, modern implementation without legacy compatibility burdens.

## Phase Breakdown

### 🚀 PHASE-1A: Core Infrastructure & Agent Workflows
**Target**: 2024-09-15 | **Priority**: Critical | **Self-Use Enabled**: ✅

**Mission**: Build foundation systems that enable agentic development workflows and allow ASD to manage its own development.

#### Active Specifications
- **FEAT-010**: ASD CLI Repository Abstraction ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **FEAT-012**: Context Injection System (P0) - 32 hours
- **FEAT-013**: Task Router System (P0) - 16 hours  
- **FEAT-014**: Workflow State Manager (P0) - 14 hours

#### Phase Goals
1. **Context-Rich Agent Handoffs**: Agents receive relevant context automatically
2. **Intelligent Task Routing**: "asd next" command provides appropriate work
3. **Automated Progress Tracking**: Real-time assignment and progress management
4. **Self-Development Ready**: ASD can manage remaining features using itself

#### Success Criteria
- [x] Repository abstraction complete (standalone npm package)
- [ ] Context injection provides 4-layer context to agents
- [ ] Task routing matches agent capabilities with available work
- [ ] Workflow state updates automatically with inline documentation
- [ ] **DOG FOOD MILESTONE**: ASD manages PHASE-1B development using itself

**Estimated Effort**: 62 hours total | **Critical Dependencies**: None

### 🏗️ PHASE-1B: Complete CLI Interface & Quality Systems  
**Target**: 2024-10-01 | **Priority**: High | **Depends On**: PHASE-1A

**Mission**: Complete the command-line interface and add quality assurance systems for production readiness.

#### Planned Specifications
- **FEAT-018**: Advanced CLI Commands (P1) - 20 hours
- **FEAT-019**: Validation Manager System (P1) - 12 hours
- **FEAT-020**: Multi-format Data Support (P1) - 8 hours
- **FEAT-021**: Project Initialization & Templates (P1) - 6 hours

#### Phase Goals
1. **Complete CLI Interface**: All operations accessible via command line
2. **Quality Assurance**: Validation and auto-fixing prevent workflow issues
3. **Multi-format Support**: JSON/YAML data formats for integration
4. **Project Templates**: Easy initialization for new projects

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive CLI commands (create, list, show, update, assign, complete)
- [ ] Validation system with auto-fixing capabilities  
- [ ] Multiple data formats supported (Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- [ ] Project initialization with customizable templates
- [ ] **PRODUCTION READY**: Alpha release suitable for external use

**Estimated Effort**: 46 hours total | **Dependencies**: PHASE-1A complete

---

### 🌟 PHASE-2A: Advanced Features & Integrations
**Target**: 2024-10-15 | **Priority**: Future | **Depends On**: PHASE-1B

**Mission**: Add advanced features, external integrations, and extensibility for broader adoption.

#### Planned Specifications
- **FEAT-022**: Integration System (GitHub/Jira) (P2) - 12 hours
- **FEAT-023**: Advanced UI Features & Themes (P2) - 10 hours  
- **FEAT-024**: Plugin Architecture & Extensions (P2) - 14 hours
- **FEAT-025**: Analytics & Export Functionality (P2) - 8 hours

#### Phase Goals
1. **External Integration**: Connect with GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear
2. **Advanced UI**: Themes, customization, enhanced visualization
3. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom workflows and integrations
4. **Analytics**: Progress tracking, velocity metrics, export capabilities

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] GitHub/Jira bidirectional sync operational
- [ ] Customizable themes and UI enhancements
- [ ] Plugin system allows community extensions
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with export capabilities
- [ ] **ECOSYSTEM READY**: Platform supports diverse development workflows

**Estimated Effort**: 44 hours total | **Dependencies**: PHASE-1B complete

## 🍽️ Self-Use Timeline ("Eating Our Own Dog Food")

### Milestone 1: Basic Self-Use (After TASK-013 + TASK-014)
**When**: ~24 hours of development  
**Capability**: 
- Use `asd next` to get recommended tasks
- Track progress automatically  
- Inline documentation updates

### Milestone 2: Full Self-Use (After PHASE-1A Complete)
**When**: ~56 hours of development  
**Capability**:
- Complete context injection for smooth agent handoffs
- Full CLI interface for all operations
- Manage PHASE-1B development entirely through ASD
- **This is our target for transitioning to self-development**

### Milestone 3: Production Self-Use (After PHASE-1B Complete)  
**When**: ~102 hours of development
**Capability**:
- Validation and quality assurance for reliable workflows
- Multi-format support for integration needs
- Project templates for consistent setup

## 📊 Development Metrics

### Time Investment by Phase
- **PHASE-1A**: 62 hours (Critical foundation)
- **PHASE-1B**: 46 hours (Complete interface) 
- **PHASE-2A**: 44 hours (Advanced features)
- **Total**: 152 hours to full-featured platform

### Feature Distribution
- **Core Systems (P0)**: 4 features, 62 hours (41%)
- **Interface & Quality (P1)**: 4 features, 46 hours (30%)  
- **Advanced Features (P2)**: 4 features, 44 hours (29%)

### Self-Development Transition
- **Traditional Development**: First 56 hours (37% of project)
- **Self-Managed Development**: Remaining 96 hours (63% of project)
- **ROI Point**: Self-use capability achieved at 37% completion

## 🎯 Strategic Decision Points

### Phase Gate 1: PHASE-1A → PHASE-1B
**Decision**: Transition to self-development or continue traditional approach?  
**Criteria**: Context injection, task routing, and state management operational  
**Recommendation**: **Transition to self-development** - validate architecture with real usage

### Phase Gate 2: PHASE-1B → PHASE-2A  
**Decision**: Focus on advanced features or expand user base?  
**Criteria**: Production-ready CLI with quality systems  
**Recommendation**: Evaluate based on user feedback and adoption metrics

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

As we develop ASD, we'll continuously refine:
- **Agent workflow patterns** based on real usage
- **Context injection relevance** based on agent feedback  
- **Task routing algorithms** based on assignment success rates
- **CLI usability** based on development efficiency gains

This roadmap represents our path from basic CLI to comprehensive agentic development platform, with the unique advantage of self-improvement through dogfooding at the 37% completion mark.

**Next Steps**: Begin PHASE-1A implementation with FEAT-012 (Context Injection System)  
**Success Measure**: Transition to self-development after PHASE-1A completion
