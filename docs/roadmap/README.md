# ASD CLI Development Roadmap

This directory contains the complete development roadmap for the **ASD CLI** (Agentic Spec Development Command Line Interface) - a standalone open-source tool for AI-first roadmap and specification management.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The ASD CLI is an advanced Terminal User Interface (TUI) and command-line tool designed for modern development workflows where AI agents collaborate on feature development. Originally embedded within the ASD development environment, this roadmap outlines the path to making it a standalone, community-driven open-source project.
