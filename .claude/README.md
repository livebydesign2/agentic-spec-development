## Quick Start for Claude

### 1. First Steps - Always Do This
```bash
# Get project overview
node bin/asd workflow dashboard

# Check what's ready for your agent type
node bin/asd next --agent software-architect
```

### 2. Standard Work Pattern
```bash
# Validate assignment
node bin/asd validate-assignment FEAT-XXX TASK-XXX --agent your-agent-type

# Assign to yourself
node bin/asd assign FEAT-XXX TASK-XXX

# Do the development work...

# Complete with automatic handoff
node bin/asd workflow complete-task FEAT-XXX TASK-XXX
```

### 3. Common Status Commands
```bash
node bin/asd workflow status        # Current assignments
node bin/asd workflow progress      # Project progress
node bin/asd workflow handoffs      # Available handoffs
node bin/asd tasks --status ready   # Available tasks
```

## Current Project Context

### Project Status
- **DOG FOOD MILESTONE**: âœ… ACHIEVED - ASD manages its own development
- **Phase**: PHASE-1A Complete, PHASE-1B Active
- **Active Specs**: 1 (with transitions happening)
- **Completed Specs**: 4
- **Ready Tasks**: 3 available for immediate development
- **Overall Progress**: 24% complete

### Immediate Priorities
1. **FEAT-012 TASK-001**: Core Context Storage & File Structure (P0 Critical)
2. **FEAT-018 TASK-001**: Core CLI Command Framework (P1 High)
3. **FEAT-019 TASK-001**: Core Validation Framework (P1 High)

### Agent Types Available
- `software-architect`: System design and technical architecture
- `cli-specialist`: Command-line interface development
- `backend-developer`: Server-side logic and APIs
- `ui-developer`: User interfaces and frontend
- `devops-engineer`: Deployment and infrastructure
- `qa-engineer`: Testing and quality assurance
- `product-manager`: Specifications and roadmap management

## Key System Features

### 1. Automated Workflow Management
- Task assignment and validation
- Automatic handoffs between agents
- Progress tracking and metrics
- Dependency management

### 2. Agent Specialization
- Role-based task routing
- Skill-specific assignments
- Context injection for agents
- Validation of agent capabilities

### 3. Systematic Task Management
- Priority-based task ordering
- Status tracking and updates
- Blocker identification and resolution
- Research and documentation capture

### 4. Self-Managing Development
- ASD manages its own development
- Specifications drive the process
- Automated progress reporting
- Quality assurance integration

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Start with ASD_USAGE_GUIDE.md** for comprehensive understanding
2. **Use COMMAND_REFERENCE.md** for quick command lookup
3. **Refer to WORKFLOW_SCENARIOS.md** for specific situations
4. **Always begin sessions by checking project status**
5. **Follow agent specialization guidelines**
6. **Use ASD commands for all task management**

## Integration with Claude Code

This documentation is designed for use with Claude Code. You can:
- Run ASD commands through the Bash tool
- Edit specifications in `docs/specs/` using file editing tools
- Follow systematic development workflows
- Maintain project state through ASD commands
- Document progress and research findings
