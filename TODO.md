# FEAT-026: Enhanced Task Automation Commands - Implementation Progress

## TASK-001: Enhanced start-next Command ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Plan:

- [x] Analyze existing CLI structure and ADR-004 requirements
- [x] Understand current TaskRouter and WorkflowStateManager integration
- [x] Build `asd start-next --agent [type]` command using Commander.js
- [x] Integrate with TaskRouter.getNextTask() for intelligent task recommendation
- [x] Add AssignmentValidator to validate agent capability and assignment constraints
- [x] Implement automatic status update: ready → in_progress in YAML and JSON
- [x] Add dependency block checking and resolution
- [x] Include comprehensive error handling with actionable error messages
- [x] Add audit logging for all automated actions
- [x] Create unit tests for command functionality
- [x] Validate (tests, lint, functionality) per "Validation Requirements"
- [x] Update & Commit: mark task [x], update "Next Available Task" + handoff notes
- [x] Product Handoff: notify Product-manager subagent to move lifecycle

### Key Components to Build:

1. **Main CLI command**: `bin/asd` - Add start-next command
2. **Command module**: `lib/commands/start-next.js` - Core automation logic
3. **Assignment validator**: `lib/automation/assignment-validator.js` - Validation engine

### Current Understanding:

- Existing TaskRecommendationAPI provides intelligent task routing
- WorkflowStateManager handles state updates and frontmatter sync
- Need to build automation wrapper that combines these systems
- ADR-004 requires comprehensive audit logging and error handling

## Next Tasks:

- TASK-002: Enhanced complete-current command (blocked until TASK-001 done)
- TASK-003: Integration testing and validation (blocked until TASK-002 done)
