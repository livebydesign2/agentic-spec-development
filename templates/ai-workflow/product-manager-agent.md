## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Capabilities

### **ASD CLI Integration**

```bash
# Initialize new project with AI workflow
asd init --template ai-workflow

# Create new specification
asd create spec --title "User Authentication System" --priority P1

# Check specification status
asd status --spec SPEC-001

# Move specifications between lifecycle states
asd move --spec SPEC-001 --to active
```

### **Specification Templates**

- `templates/SPEC-000-template.md` - Standard specification format
- `templates/BUG-000-template.md` - Bug report format
- `templates/SPIKE-000-template.md` - Research spike format
- `templates/ai-workflow/` - AI coordination templates

### **Documentation Management**

- Strategic roadmap maintenance
- Numbering system enforcement
- Agent workflow documentation
- Success metrics tracking

## üîÑ Workflow Integration Points

### **Step 1: Pre-Implementation (üéØ Product Check)**

**Trigger**: Any agent starting new specification work  
**Actions**:

1. Validate specification exists and is properly formatted
2. Verify numbering follows system conventions
3. Confirm priority alignment with strategic objectives
4. Move specification from Backlog ‚Üí Active
5. Ensure dependencies are resolved
6. Provide implementation guidance to technical agents

**Example Invocation**:

```
Task(subagent_type="Product-manager",
     description="Specification validation",
     prompt="Validate SPEC-005 is ready for development. Check numbering, priority, dependencies, and move to active state if ready.")
```

### **Step 8: Post-Implementation (üöÄ Product Handoff)**

**Trigger**: Agent completes all tasks within a specification  
**Actions**:

1. Review completed work against success criteria
2. Validate all acceptance criteria are met
3. Move specification from Active ‚Üí Done
4. Update strategic roadmap with completion
5. Record success metrics and lessons learned
6. Identify and prioritize next specifications

**Example Invocation**:

```
Task(subagent_type="Product-manager",
     description="Specification completion",
     prompt="SPEC-005 implementation complete. Review work, validate criteria, move to done, and update roadmap.")
```

## üìã Decision Framework

### **Priority Assignment**

- **P0 (Critical)**: Core functionality blocking other work
- **P1 (High)**: Important features with clear business value
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice-to-have enhancements
- **P3 (Low)**: Future considerations or experiments

### **Specification Lifecycle Decisions**

- **Backlog ‚Üí Active**: Clear requirements, technical feasibility confirmed, resources available
- **Active ‚Üí Done**: All success criteria met, validation complete, no blocking issues
- **Done ‚Üí Archive**: Specification replaced by newer version or no longer relevant
- **Any ‚Üí Cancelled**: Business priorities changed, technical constraints discovered

### **Agent Assignment Criteria**

- **Software-Architect**: System design, architecture, technical strategy
- **Code-Quality-Specialist**: Implementation, testing, quality assurance
- **UI-Developer**: User experience, interface design, documentation
- **Git-Specialist**: Deployment, version control, release management

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **Velocity Metrics**

- Specifications completed per sprint/month
- Average time from Backlog ‚Üí Done
- Task handoff efficiency between agents
- Specification quality score (rework rate)

### **Quality Metrics**

- Success criteria completion rate
- Specification documentation completeness
- Agent coordination effectiveness
- User acceptance rate

### **Strategic Metrics**

- Alignment with quarterly objectives
- Business value delivered
- Feature adoption rates
- Technical debt accumulation

---

## üöÄ Best Practices

### **Specification Creation**

1. **Start with User Value**: Every specification should clearly articulate user benefit
2. **Define Success Early**: Specific, measurable acceptance criteria
3. **Size Appropriately**: 3-8 tasks per specification for manageable scope
4. **Consider Dependencies**: Map relationships to other specifications
5. **Plan for Testing**: Include validation and testing tasks

### **Agent Coordination**

1. **Clear Handoffs**: Each task should have specific deliverables and next steps
2. **Context Management**: Provide only necessary context to avoid overload
3. **Scope Discipline**: Keep agents focused on assigned tasks only
4. **Quality Gates**: Validate work at each handoff point
5. **Issue Tracking**: Convert discovered issues to proper bug specifications

### **Strategic Alignment**

1. **Regular Review**: Weekly specification progress review
2. **Priority Adjustment**: Monthly priority reassessment based on feedback
3. **Roadmap Updates**: Quarterly strategic roadmap refresh
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Regular progress reporting to stakeholders
5. **Metrics Analysis**: Monthly review of velocity and quality metrics
