# Base Agent Template

This template serves as the foundation for all ASD agent definitions. It provides common patterns, validation rules, and inheritance structures that ensure consistency and functionality across all agents.

## üéØ Purpose

The base agent template provides:

- **Consistent Structure**: All agents follow the same basic format and include required fields
- **Inheritance Patterns**: New agents can inherit common capabilities and workflows
- **Validation Framework**: Ensures all agent definitions meet quality standards
- **Integration Support**: Provides hooks for ASD system integration and context injection

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Structure

### Required Components

Every agent definition must include:

1. **Agent Type**: Unique identifier for the agent (lowercase, hyphenated)
2. **Specializations**: Areas where the agent has expertise
3. **Context Requirements**: Information the agent needs to be effective
4. **Capabilities**: Specific deliverables the agent can produce
5. **Workflow Steps**: Typical process the agent follows
6. **Validation Requirements**: Quality standards the agent must meet
7. **Handoff Checklist**: Items needed for successful task completion

### Optional Components

Agents can also include:

- **Technology Focus**: Specific tools and technologies
- **Quality Standards**: Detailed quality criteria
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Common Patterns**: Reusable approaches and solutions

## üîÑ Template Inheritance

### Creating New Agents

When creating a new agent, you can inherit from this base template:

1. **Copy Structure**: Use the same YAML frontmatter structure
2. **Inherit Capabilities**: Extend common capability patterns
3. **Customize Workflows**: Adapt workflow steps to agent specialization
4. **Add Specializations**: Define specific areas of expertise

### Inheritance Options

- **extend_capabilities**: Add capabilities to inherited ones
- **override_workflow**: Replace inherited workflow entirely
- **merge_context_requirements**: Combine with parent requirements
- **customize_validation**: Add agent-specific validation rules

## ‚úÖ Validation Framework

### Automatic Validation

All agent definitions are automatically validated for:

- **Required Fields**: Ensures all mandatory fields are present
- **Field Formats**: Validates field types and formats
- **Minimum Requirements**: Checks minimum number of items in arrays
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent terminology and structure

### Quality Standards

Agent definitions must meet these standards:

- **Clarity**: All descriptions are clear and actionable
- **Completeness**: All required information is provided
- **Consistency**: Follows established patterns and terminology
- **Specificity**: Capabilities and requirements are specific and measurable

## üîó System Integration

### Context Injection

The base template integrates with ASD's context injection system:

- **Context Requirements**: Used to filter relevant context information
- **Specializations**: Guide context relevance scoring
- **Workflow Steps**: Inform process template selection

### CLI Integration

Agent definitions integrate with ASD CLI commands:

- **Agent Listing**: `asd agent list` shows agent capabilities
- **Agent Customization**: `asd agent customize` uses template structure
- **Task Assignment**: `asd assign` uses capability matching

### Capability Matching

The template supports automatic task assignment:

- **Specialization Matching**: Tasks matched to agent specializations
- **Keyword Mapping**: Capabilities mapped to task keywords
- **Handoff Patterns**: Guide workflow coordination between agents

## üìö Best Practices

### Creating Effective Agents

- **Focus on Outcomes**: Define what the agent delivers, not just what they know
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague capabilities and requirements
- **Consider Handoffs**: Plan how work flows between agents
- **Test Integration**: Ensure agent works with ASD's context and CLI systems

### Maintaining Consistency

- **Use Standard Terminology**: Follow established patterns for similar concepts
- **Align with Industry Standards**: Use recognized role definitions where applicable
- **Regular Updates**: Keep agent definitions current with system changes
- **Document Changes**: Track template evolution for backward compatibility

## üöÄ Getting Started

To create a new agent based on this template:

1. **Copy Template**: Start with the base structure
2. **Define Specializations**: Identify 3-5 key expertise areas
3. **List Capabilities**: Define specific deliverables
4. **Design Workflow**: Create 3-5 logical workflow steps
5. **Set Quality Standards**: Define validation and handoff requirements
6. **Test Integration**: Verify agent works with ASD systems

This base template ensures that all ASD agents are consistent, functional, and well-integrated with the broader system while allowing for specialization and customization.
