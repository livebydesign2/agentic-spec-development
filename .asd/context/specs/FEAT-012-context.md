# FEAT-012: Context Injection System - Context

## Specification Overview

The Context Injection System is the **foundation feature** for PHASE-1A that enables sophisticated AI agent workflows. It provides multi-layer context injection, automatic learning accumulation, and customizable agent workflows.

**Critical Path**: This feature enables all other agent workflow features. FEAT-013 (Task Router) and FEAT-014 (Workflow State Manager) both depend on the context system being functional.

## Research Findings

### Context Layer Analysis

Through analysis of successful AI agent systems (particularly Claude's sub-agent pattern), identified that agents need:

1. **Static Context**: Unchanging project constraints and agent capabilities
2. **Dynamic Context**: Real-time task assignments and current system state
3. **Semi-Dynamic Context**: Research findings and implementation decisions that accumulate over time
4. **Process Context**: Customizable workflow templates and validation checklists

### File Format Decision

Chose **YAML frontmatter + Markdown content** pattern because:

- Human readable and editable
- Programmatically parseable with existing js-yaml library
- Consistent with existing ASD spec format
- Follows Claude's proven sub-agent definition pattern
- Enables context inheritance and composition

### Performance Considerations

Context injection performance critical for CLI responsiveness:

- Target: < 500ms for context injection to maintain CLI usability
- File system caching needed for frequently accessed context
- Context relevance filtering prevents information overload
- Lazy loading for context layers not needed for specific tasks

## Implementation Decisions

### Directory Structure Design

```
.asd/
├── agents/          # Agent definitions (Claude-style MD + YAML)
├── processes/       # Workflow templates and validation checklists
├── context/         # Context storage
│   ├── project.md   # Project-wide constraints and architecture
│   ├── specs/       # Spec-specific research and decisions
│   └── tasks/       # Task-level context and progress
├── state/           # Dynamic state (JSON for performance)
├── config/          # Context system configuration
└── logs/            # Operation logs and debugging
```

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, human navigable, follows existing ASD patterns

### Context Inheritance Pattern

- **Project Context**: Shared by all agents and tasks
- **Spec Context**: Inherits from project, adds spec-specific constraints and findings
- **Task Context**: Inherits from spec and project, adds task-specific implementation notes
- **Agent Context**: Filtered view based on agent capabilities and context requirements

### Automatic Update Triggers

Context files update automatically based on:

- Task lifecycle events (start, progress, complete)
- Agent research and decision documentation
- CLI command execution that generates new insights
- Manual updates via `asd context` commands

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration

- **ConfigManager**: Extend to support `.asd/` directory configuration
- **SpecParser**: Integrate context loading during spec parsing
- **CLI Commands**: Add context management commands to existing command structure
- **DataAdapterFactory**: Leverage for context file format support

### New System Components

- **ContextInjector**: Core engine for multi-layer context assembly
- **ContextManager**: File operations and update management
- **AgentMatcher**: Matches agents to tasks based on capabilities
- **ProcessTemplateManager**: Manages workflow templates and customization

## Critical Success Factors

### Agent Effectiveness

- Agents receive relevant context without information overload
- Context filtering based on agent type and task requirements works accurately
- Learning accumulates effectively over time without manual intervention

### Human Observability

- All agent decisions and context are human-readable
- Context files can be manually edited when needed
- System state is transparent and debuggable

### Performance

- Context injection doesn't slow down CLI operations
- File system operations are optimized for frequent access
- Memory usage remains reasonable for large projects

### Maintainability

- Context system is extensible for future agent types
- Process templates can be customized for different team workflows
- System gracefully handles context file corruption or inconsistencies

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Context Relevance

**Problem**: Agents could be overwhelmed with irrelevant context
**Solution**: Agent-specific filtering based on `context_requirements` in agent definitions

### Challenge: File System Performance

**Problem**: Frequent context file reads/writes could slow CLI
**Solution**: Intelligent caching, lazy loading, and batch update operations

### Challenge: Context Consistency

**Problem**: Multiple agents updating context could create conflicts
**Solution**: Append-only logging for most updates, structured merge for conflicts

### Challenge: Human Usability

**Problem**: Generated context files could become unreadable
**Solution**: Maintain markdown format, clear section organization, avoid machine-generated complexity

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Prerequisites (Completed)

- ✅ ConfigManager supports flexible configuration
- ✅ SpecParser handles YAML frontmatter parsing
- ✅ DataAdapterFactory supports multiple file formats
- ✅ Basic CLI command structure established

### Current Blockers

- None identified - FEAT-012 is the foundation task

### Downstream Dependencies

- **FEAT-013 (Task Router)**: Needs context system for agent/task matching
- **FEAT-014 (Workflow State Manager)**: Needs context updates for state tracking
- **All PHASE-1B features**: Depend on agent workflow foundation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics

- Context injection completes in < 500ms for typical tasks
- Agent context filtering accuracy: 90%+ relevant information included
- Context file readability: Human can understand and edit all generated files
- Update reliability: 99%+ of context updates complete successfully

### Workflow Metrics

- Agent task pickup time: < 2 minutes from context injection to work start
- Context accumulation: Research findings and decisions persist across tasks
- Customization effectiveness: Teams can successfully modify agent workflows

**Next Update Trigger**: When TASK-001 (Core Context Storage & File Structure) completes
**Context Inheritance**: This spec context will be inherited by all FEAT-012 tasks
